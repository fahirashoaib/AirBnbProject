# AirBnbProject

## React + Vite app

* This is a simple version of [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) website.
* This project is somewhat incomplete and needs to be completed in its functionalities e.g. authentication, admin-dashbaord, and booking page.
* After signing or loging in, we have a user dashboard and an admin dashboard based on the roles.
* In the user dashboard, we have homepage, listing deatils page and booking page.
* MongoDB Compass was used for handling the database locally.
